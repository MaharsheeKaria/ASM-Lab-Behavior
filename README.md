# trait-anxiety
Testing a project on automated analysis of trait anxiety in zebrafish using Python code.

Several experiments on fish have been performed using a certain set-up. The information from the experiments (coordinates of the fish, number of frames, etc.) get saved in .xls files. This project involves extracting valuable information from the data collected and analysing it.
